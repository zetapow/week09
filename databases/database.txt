TYPES OF DATABASE
- relational database
--- data as rows and columns in series of tables
--- use SQL for writing and querying data 
--- tables and relations important

- Hierarchical database
--- modelled in a tree-like structure with pointers. Each record has one parent record and many children

- Network Database
--- Network model allows each record to have multiple parent - child records

- Object-Oriented database
--- info represented in form of objects, with fields, properties and methods


- cloud DB
